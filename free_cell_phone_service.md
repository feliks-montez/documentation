# How to: Free Cell Phone Service

## FreedomPop
### (200 Minutes, 500 Texts, and 200MB+ Data)

1. Buy a smartphone
	* Runs recent version of OS (preferably the latest)
	* Has GSM SIM card slot
	* Is unlocked or unlockable (you'll have to manually unlock it if it's not)
	* Not LG brand (they don't have the important APN setting)
2. Get FreedomPop GSM SIM card and FREE account
	* Go to [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=Freedompop+Global+GSM+3-in-1+SIM+Kit&rlz=1CAHPZY_enUS596US599&oq=Freedompop+Global+GSM+3-in-1+SIM+Kit&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=0&ie=UTF-8) to look for their latest offer for a GSM 3 in 1 SIM Kit
	* When you buy the SIM Kit, it will create an account. Your password will be in an email from FreedomPop. Don't forget to change you password
	* DOWNGRADE!!! Downgrade both to the FREE data plan and get rid of FreedomPop Premium or they will charge you!
3. Install SIM in phone and power on. It should recognise the SIM card as "FreedomPop"
4. Go to Settings > Wireless & networks > More > Cellular Networks > Access Point Names. Add a new APN called "FreedomPop" and under "APN" put "freedompop.foggmobile.com"
5. Install the FreedomPop Messaging app from the Google Play Store
6. Open Messaging. Click OK a few times, and it should arrive at the main screen. If you see a red "Account Error" message, try reinstalling the app and restarting the phone a few times.
7. You can now text and call through this app. It will allow you to use data on your own, as long as it's enabled. KEEP WI-FI ON, so that it won't chew through your limited data unless it has to!

## Google Voice/Hangouts
### (Calling, Texting, and Group Texting)

1. Create a Google account if you don't already have one.
2. Get a Google Voice number. You'll need to enter another real phone number (like your FreedomPop one) in order to get a Voice number.
3. Go to Voice settings to change a few things:
	* Under the "Phones" tab, make sure Google Chat is enabled and all other phones are disabled.
	* Under the "Voicemail & Text" tab, uncheck "Text Forwarding" (optional)
	* Under the "Calls" tab, turn off "Call Screening"
4. Install Google Hangouts and Hangouts Dialer and set them up using the same account as your Google Voice.
5. In Hangouts settings, turn on "Incoming Phone Calls" and "Messages".
6. You should be able to use Hangouts to text people using it's SMS feature and call people using the Hangouts Dialer.

_Note:_ FreedomPop SIM cards are from the UK, so you'll run into country code issues when trying to contact other people through hangouts unless you specify the correct country code (which is +1 in the US). To fix this, install "Twitch 2!" which will allow you to format all of your contacts at once. Format them all to US phone numbers (country code is +1).

## TextNow
### (Calling, Texting)

_Note:_ This does not support group texting, which will only be an inconvenience occasionally. It's not a required thing.
1. Install the TextNow app and create an account with them. Pick a phone number.
2. You're done! Use This app to text and call. It will use Wi-Fi when possible and switch to data when it's not.
